I began to\n      perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\n      immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\n      in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\n      shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\n      the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\n      deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\n      have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\n      for ever on manâ€™s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it\n      off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\n      pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too\n      evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only\n      recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain\n      of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by\n      which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a\n      second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me\n      because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements\n      in my soul.\n  ")]),e._v(" "),n("p",{staticClass:"centered text-center",attrs:{id:"output"}})])}],!1,null,"39e76a3b",null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
